 Loadouts
----------
The loadouts are useful for quickly get all the weapons you want fast, e.g: to equip yourself when you're playing as NOOSE. The plugins includes three loadouts by default(FIB.xml, LSPD_LSSD.xml and Noose.xml) placed inside Plugins\Police Station Armory Resources\Loadouts.
You can create your own loadouts, this can be achieve by editing the XML file manually or by using the included program Police Station Armory Loadouts Creator.exe. The last option is easiest one because you can see all the available options.
The program window has three main zones Name, Texture Name and Items, to know how to use each one follow the written instructions. To load a loadout XML file and edit it again click the "Load Loadout" button and search for the file you want to edit.
Once you're happy with your loadout click the "Save Loadout" button and save it in your Plugins\Police Station Resources\Loadouts folder and then when you enter the armory in-game you should see your loadout under the Loadouts menu.
Normally, if an error happens, a window will show saying what the error is and you will have to send me a screenshot of the error window to be able to help you.
